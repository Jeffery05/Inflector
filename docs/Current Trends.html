                            have been willing to sell houses because they spend the majority of time at home. In order to combat 
                            inflation, mortgage rates have risen, which drives away potential customers because the rates are 
                            so high. Overall, there are not enough homes to meet demand.</p>

                            these projects becomes smaller, which drives up inflation as a result.

                            are government or privately-established healthcare providers. However, shortages of supply from world 
                            conflicts and the pandemic have caused labs to be missing tools and other research equipment, making 
                            medicine production more costly. While this hasn't had a significant impact on the industry, it could
